# Simple Game Store

## Description
This is a simple example of an online store project, in my case a gaming one, implemented using React/Redux. 
The game store uses a pre-prepared list of games, storing it in a json file; this list can be expanded. 
The functionality is quite simple - adding, deleting, viewing games, as well as interacting with the shopping cart and application pages.

## How to start use
1. If you do not have Node.js, install it on official site. My version `18.9.1` (recommended version is `>18`).  
Can use `nvm` to switch the version. 
2. Clone repository via
```
git clone https://github.com/HoloborodkoM/game-store.git
```
3. Open a terminal and change directory
   ```
   cd game-store
   ```
4. Pull up dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. To run the project, use the next command
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the running project.

After these steps you will see the game store and you can learn how components are made and work in React.
